A Simple Recommender System In Java

This reads in the csv file recsys-data-ratings.csv and then works out CoRatings values.

These are the movies most also rated with the three movies movieA, movieB and movieC.

The data file contains an id representing the user, an id representing the movie and a double representing their rating.

This application calculates a) which movies are most co-rated with the input movie (written to pa-result)
and b) does rating X make rating Y more likely.

Output is to a text file called pa-result.txt
